Describe the present state of the algorithm
	* What does each entity do?
		** Simulation
		** Metropolis-Hastings
		** Differences between Real and RealTempered
	* Wrappers
	* Evaluation of results.

Information on data storage.
Storing the neighbours.

Create appendices, where description of particular functions is stored.
		


Finish off the theoretical part

Combine Data

Describe the results using ggplot2 and combinded data

Finish off the Motivation.

1. Implement Sojourn Time verifier : two classifiers: Promo and Distancio.
2. Move the example to introduction: will serve as motivation. 
3. Merge real and realTempered, for it is absurd the way it is now. 
4. Understand better the theory behind the simulations. The convergence. The sojourn times. What is mixing all about ( this would probably require enrolling on a course in dynamic systems ).
5. Compare every results with the basic generation method, when
the formula is known.

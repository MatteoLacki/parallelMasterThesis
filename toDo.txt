1. Implement Sojourn Time verifier : two classifiers: Promo and Distancio.
2. Move the example to introduction: will serve as motivation. 
3. Merge real and realTempered, for it is absurd the way it is now. 
4. Understand better the theory behind the simulations. The convergence. The sojourn times. What is mixing all about ( this would probably require enrolling on a course in dynamic systems ).
5. Compare every results with the basic generation method, when
the formula is known.
